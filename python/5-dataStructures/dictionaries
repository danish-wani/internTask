Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as "'associative memories" or "associative arrays". Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only stings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key.

It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key:value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}.


Performing list(d) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order(if we want it sorted, use sorted(d) instead).
To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, we can use in keyword.
