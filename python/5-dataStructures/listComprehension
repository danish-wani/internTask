A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it.

e.g.,
	squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

	
	[(x,y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]

	vec=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
	[num for i in vec for num in i]
output:	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
