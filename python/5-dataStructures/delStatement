There is way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the del statement. This differs from the pop() method which returns a value. It can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list.

e.g.,
	a=[-10,3,6,12,30,44,57,76]
	del a[0]

	del a[1:3]
	
	del a[:]


	del can also be used to delete entire variables:
	
	del a
	
	-referencing a hereafter is an error
