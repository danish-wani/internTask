	Looping Techniques

-When looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the items() method.

e.g,
	students={'danish':29,'qais':3,'basit':18}
	for n, r in students.items():
		print(n,":",r)

-When looping through sequence, the position index and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the enumerate() function.

e.g.,
	for i, v in enumerate(['tic','tac','toe']:
		print(i,":",v)


-To loop over two or more sequences at the same time, the enteries can be paired with the zip() function.
e.g.,
	questions=['name','favorite color']
	answers=['danish','blue']
	for q, a in zip(questions,answers):
		print('Your {0} is {1}',q,a)

-To loop over a sequence in reverse, first specify the sequence in a forward direction and then call the reversed() function.
e.g.,
	for i in reversed(range(1,10,2)):
		print(i)

-To loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the sorted() function which returns a new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered.
e.g.,
	basket=['apple','orange','banana','pear','peach']
	for i in sorted(set(basket)):
		print(f)
