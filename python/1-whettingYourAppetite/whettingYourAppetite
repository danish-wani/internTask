Python is an object oriented language with high level data structures, dynamic typing, strongly typing and dynamic binding.(https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/static-vs-dynamic-typing-of-programming-languages/)(https://wiki.python.org/moin/Why%20is%20Python%20a%20dynamic%20language%20and%20also%20a%20strongly%20typed%20language)

--It has high level built in data types such as, flexible arrays and dictionaries.

The language is named after the BBC show "Monty Python's Flying Circus".
Python allows us to split our program into modules that can be reused in other python programs.

--It is an interpreted language.

--high level data types allow us to express complex operations in a single statement.
--statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning & end brackets.
--no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

Python is extensible:for example, we can write a critical piece of code that needs to be run very fast in c/c++ and then combine with our python program.
