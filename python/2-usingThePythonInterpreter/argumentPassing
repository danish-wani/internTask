Argument Passing

The script name and the additional arguments are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the 'argv' variable in the 'sys' module. we can access this list by executing 'import sys'.
	sys.argv[0] always holds the script name
	and sys.argv[1..n] holds the arguments repectively.

argumentPassingExample.py  in the same directory calculates the factorial of any number passed as an argument from the interactive mode. 

for example:

	$python3 argumentPassingExample.py  5
	
	sys.argv[1] will contain 5 and the factorial of 5 will be given as output.
