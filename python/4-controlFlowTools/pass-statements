The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required  sytactically but the program requires no action. 
For example:
	
	while True:
		pass	#busy-wait for keyboard interrupt

This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:
	class MyEmptyClass:
		pass


Another place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when we are working on new code, allowing us to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The pass is silently ignored:
	
	def initlog(*args):
		pass	# remember to implement this
