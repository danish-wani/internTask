	range() function	

If we need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in functon range() comes in handy. It generates arithmetic progressions:
e.g.,
	for i in range(5):
		print(i)
output:
	0
	1
	2
	3
	4

-- The given end point is never part of the generated sequence.
-- It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different increment.

e.g.,
	range(5,10)
	5,6,7,8,9
	
	range(0,10,3)
	0,3,6,9

	range(-100,-200,-30)
	-100,-130,-160,-190


To iterate over the indices of a sequence, we can combine range() and len() as follows:
	
	football=['premiere','league','started','last','week']
	for i in range(len(football)):
		print(i,a[i])

	0 premiere
	1 league
	2 started
	3 last
	4 week

We say such an object is iterable, that is, suitable as a target for functions and constructs that expect something from which they can obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted. We have seen tha the for statement is such an iterator. The function list() is another;it creates lists from iterables:

	list(range(5))
	[0,1,2,3,4]
