		coding style

-- use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.
-- wrap lines so that they don't exceed 79 chars.
-- use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.
-- when possible, put comments on a line of their own.
-- use docstrings
-- use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs.
-- name classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use camelcase for classes and lower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods. Always use self as the name for the first method argument.
