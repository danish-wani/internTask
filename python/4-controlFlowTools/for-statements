	for statements

Python's for statement iterates over the items of any sequence( a list or a string ), in the order that they appear in the sequence.

e.g.,
	words=['cat','window','laptop','desktop']
	for w in words:
		print(w,len(w))

If we need to modify the sequence we are iterating over while inside the loop, it is recommended that we first make a copy. Iterating over a sequence does not implicitly make a copy. The slice notation makes this especially convenient:
e.g.,
	for w in words[:]:
		if(len(w) > 6 ):
			words.insert(0,w)

	words
output: ['desktop','cat','window','laptop','desktop']
