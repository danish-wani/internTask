		documentation strings

some conventions about the content and formatting of documentation strings:

--first line should always be short, concise summary of the object's purpose
--if there are more lines in the documentation string, the second line should be blank, visually separating the summary from the rest of the description.

e.g.,
	def my_function():
		"""Do nothing, but document it.

		NO, really, it doesn't do anything.
		"""
		pass



	print(my_function.__doc__)			# __doc__ is the attribute of the function
