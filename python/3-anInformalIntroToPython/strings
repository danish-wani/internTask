	Strings
Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or
double quotes ("...") with the same result.
\ can be used to escape quotes.

if we don't want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted as special characters, we can use RAW strings by adding an r before the first quote:
for example:
	>>>print('c:\some\name')	#here \n means newline!
	c:\some
	ame
	
	>>>print(r'c:some\name')	#note the r before the quote
	c:\some\name

String literals can span multiple lines.One way is using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''.  End of line are automatically included in the string, but it's possible to prevent this by adding a \ at the end of the line.


Concatenation:
	Strings can be concatenated with the + operator and
	repeated with * :

for example:
	firstname="danish"
	lastname="wani"
	print(firstname + lastname)	#concatenating first and last name

output:	danishwani

	3 * danish	# 3 times danish
output:	danishdanishdanish


Strings can be indexed, with the first char having index 0. There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one.
Indices may also be negative.
e.g.,
		D	A	N	I	S	H
indices:	0	1	2	3	4	5
		-6	-5	-4	-3	-2	-1


Slicing:	Slicing allows us to obtain substring

for example:
	>>> word="python"
	>>> word[0:2]
output:	'py'

SYNTAX:	string[start:end]	# start is always included & end is always excluded

	s[:i] + s[i:]	# always gives s

--Attempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error:
	IndexError: string index out of range


Python strings can not be changed, they are immutable

for example.,
	>>>word[0]='t'
	TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

Length of a string  len(string):

e.g., 
	>>> len(word)
	6
