		PYTHON SCOPES AND NAMESPACES

A namespace is a mapping from names to objects.Most namespaces are currently implemented as python dictionaries, but that's normally not noticeable in any way and it may change in the future.

A scope is a textual region of a python program where a namespace is directly accessible. 'Directly accessible' here means that an unqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the namespace.
