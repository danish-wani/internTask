class MyClass:
	i = 12345
	def f(self):
		return 'hello world'

		


							Instance Objects

The only operation understood by instance objects are attribute references.
There are two kinds of valid attribute names, data attributes and methods.

Data attributes correspond to 'data members' in c++. Data attributes need not be declared; like local variables, they spring into existence when they are first assigned to.

The other kind of instance attribute reference is a method. A method is a function that 'belongs to' an object. 
Valid method names of an instance object depend on its class. By definition, all attributes of a class that are function objects define corresponding methods of its instances. 


							Method Objects

Usually, a method is called right after it is bound:

x.f()

In the MyClass example, this will return the string 'hello world'. However, its not necessary to call a method right away: x.f is a method object, and can be stored away and called  at later time.
