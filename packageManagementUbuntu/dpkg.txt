				dpkg package manager


dpkg is a package manager for Debian-based systems.
It can install, remove and build packages, but unlike other package management systems, it cannot automatically download and install packages or their dependencies.

			to list all packages installed on the system:	dpkg -l

			to find a specific package if installed:	dpkg -l | grep <packagename>
			
			to list the files installed by a package:	dpkg -L <packagename>

			to find which package installed a file:		dpkg -S <path/filename>

			to install a local .deb (debian package) file:		sudo dpkg -i <filename.deb>

			to uninstall a package:		sudo dpkg -r <filename>		----not recommended as it can cause dependency failures
